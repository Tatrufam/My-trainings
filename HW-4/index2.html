    <p>Hello! My name is Tatyana and I'm almost 40. I've just recently started training for a QA manual at Hillel Computer School. Briefly about me: I am a logistician with almost 20 years of experience. I started as a logistics trainee and reached to the position of an executive director of a freight forwarding company, and later co-owner of my own small company. At the age of 38, I decided to change my life and left the business. I took a break for a year to understand myself. It turned out that deep down in my heart, I really regret that in my youth I gave up the idea of ​​going in the direction of IT. I decided to fix the situation.</p>
	<p>P.S. <em>I know that this is not the information that is usually indicated on the resume for IT sphere, but I hope that after completing the courses, I will be able to redo and re-fill this resume properly.)))</em></p>
