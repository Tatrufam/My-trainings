Hello! My name is Tatyana. I just recently started training for a QA. I hope that after completing the courses at Hillel School, I will be able to completely redo and re-fill this resume.))) Briefly about me: I am a logistician with almost 20 years of experience. I went from being a logistics trainee to an executive director of a freight forwarding company, and then co-owner of my own small company.
